-- SQL - Hard

-- Consider the following relational database schema:

-- SELLER (S_id, Name, Bank_acc_no, Email, Phone)
-- STOCKS (S_id, Prod_id, S_Date)
-- PRODUCT (Prod_id, Prod_name, Description, Price, Expiry_date)

-- Create the Following Tables:

CREATE TABLE SELLER (

    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Bank_acc_no VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100),

    Prod_id INT,
